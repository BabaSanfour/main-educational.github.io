## Representational structure in neural time series using calcium imaging and electrophysiology

### Instructors
**Dr. Quinn Lee** is a CIHR/FRQ postdoctoral research fellow in the Brandon Lab at McGill University (Montreal, QC, Canada). Prior to joining the Brandon Lab, he completed my PhD at the University of Lethbridge (Lethbridge, AB, Canada) with Drs. Robert Sutherland and Robert McDonald studying how long-term memory is organized at the systems-level in the brain. His current work aims to understand how aspects of experience and memory are represented in neuronal population activity in the rodent hippocampus across protracted experience. To this end, he uses a combination of miniscope calcium imaging in freely moving animals, advanced behavioral tracking, and computational methods to explore questions about neuronal representation and behavior.

**Giuseppe P Gava** is a postdoctoral neuroscientist in the Dupret Lab at the MRC BNDU, University of Oxford. He was awarded a PhD from the Centre for Doctoral Training in Neurotechnology at Imperial College London, where he also graduated in Biomedical Engineering. He aims to use concepts from network science, topology and information theory to understand the complex neural circuitry and dynamics that shape memory and cognition.

### Objectives
 * Basics data analysis for in vivo calcium imaging time series from freely-behaving animals
 * Basics data analysis for electrophysiological time series from freely-behaving animals

### Materials
To be announced.

## Keynote Patrick Mineault

**Patrick Mineault** is a neurotechnologist and CEO of xcorr consulting. His career spans academia and industry: he was a data scientist at Google, research scientist at Meta on brain-computer-interfaces, founder of a medtech startup and founding CTO of the educational nonprofit Neuromatch. His research at the intersection of neuroscience and AI has been published in NeurIPS, Neuron, PNAS, J Neurosci and Plos Comp Bio. He is the author of the Good Research Code Handbook and writes a popular computational neuroscience blog, [xcorr.net](https://xcorr.net/). He obtained his PhD in computational neuroscience at McGill University.

**Title**: What's the endgame of neuroAI?

**Summary**: Neuroscience and AI have a long, intertwined history. Artificial intelligence pioneers looked to the principles of the organization of the brain as inspiration to make intelligent machines. In a surprising reversal, AI is now helping us understand its very source of inspiration: the human brain. Over the next decade, we’ll make ever more precise in silico brain models. As a result, we’ll soon be able to download and use sensory models, on demand, with the same convenience that we can do object recognition or natural language processing.

In this talk, I will take you on a tour of the near future. I will argue that we should use this newfound capability to help improve human health, both for people with neurological disorders and to enhance the well. I discuss enabling technological trends: advances in AI, industrial use cases, AR/VR and BCI. I invite everyone to reflect on the role of innovation and academia to help humans flourish.
